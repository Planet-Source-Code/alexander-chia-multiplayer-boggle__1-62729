### Description

Multiplayer Boggle ==&gt;

An attempt to create a multiplayer version of the popular game Boggle to play with my friends online.

----

Features include:

-Ability to customize almost every aspect of the round (eg Time of each round, interval timing, minimum word length, etc.)

-A plethora of awards (eg Champion medal, Caterpillar word award, Treasure hunter award, Detective award, etc.) to be awarded to outstanding players every round!

-Custom coded Depth First Search to find if word entered exists in board

-Top 50 words of each round displayed after each round

-In-game Dictionary to display dictionary entry of any of the top 50 words. Just click on the word in the listbox and an explanation will pop up.

-Interesting End-round statistics shown (eg % of total words found, typing speed, words found by each player, etc.)

-Dynamic in-game chat

-A short help tab to explain to beginners how to play this game by Hasbro, as well as to display the awards that could be won

-Gigantic internationally recognized lexicon of words (Enable2k) for nearly every valid word in the dictionary to be recognized by the game.
